I am Saffet Gökçen Şen. I am working on causal inference within the framework of Judea Pearl. I have a blog about causal inference and machine learning on this [link][My-blog]. 

I am also interested in full-stack development. I am enrolled in the [Odin Project][Odin-home]. The Odin Project offers a free full-stack curriculum. This curriculum is supported by a passionate open source community. On this website, I share my implementations of the projects from the Odin Project curriculum.

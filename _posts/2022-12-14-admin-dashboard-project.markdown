This is my seventh project in my journey to being a full stack developer. In this project, an admin dashboard is created. The webpage is designed for a laptop screen. Therefore, it is not responsive. The aim is to practice the grid technology. The flex technology is also used. The original project description is on this [link][Odin-link]. 

My implementation of the project for a laptop screen can be reached [here][My-implementation].

This is my third project in my journey to being a full stack developer. In this project, the rock-paper-scissors game is played between the user and the computer. There is a simple user-interface. The user-interface is implemented only for large-screen devices. This project is my first Javascript programming practice. The detailed information about the project is on this [link][Odin-link]. 

My implementation of the project for large-screen devices can be reached [here][My-implementation]. The game is started by the user after pressing one of the rock, paper and scissors buttons. The user's hand and the computer's hand are displayed on the black badge. The scores are displayed on the green badge. Whoever reaches the score of 5 wins the game. The winner and the score are printed on the screen.

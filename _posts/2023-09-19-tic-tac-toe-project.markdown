This is my ninth project in my journey to being a full stack developer. This project is from the full-stack Javascript path of the Odin Project. A tic tac toe game that can be played in browsers is made for large-screen devices. The aim of the project is to exercise on the scope concept, the closure concept, the factory functions, the module pattern and the prototype based object oriented programming. There are three choices for the size of the game board. To cancel a move, click on that move again. To complete a move, click on the "Change player" button. The program does not let a player to make disallowed moves. The original project description is on this [link][Odin-link]. 

My implementation of the project for large-screen devices can be reached [here][My-implementation].

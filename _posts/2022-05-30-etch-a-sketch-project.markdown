This is my fourth project in my journey to being a full stack developer. In this project, a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an etch-a-sketch is to be built. The drawing is started by double-clicking on the grid and it is stopped again by double-clicking on the grid. Hence, disjoint regions can be easily drawn. The drawing pad has a fixed dimension of 960x960 pixels. The original project description is on this [link][Odin-link]. 

My implementation of the project for large-screen devices can be reached [here][My-implementation]. The resolution of the drawing pad can be set by the user.

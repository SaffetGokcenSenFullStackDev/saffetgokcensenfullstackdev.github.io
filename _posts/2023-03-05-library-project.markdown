This is my eighth project in my journey to being a full stack developer. The aim of the project is to practice Javascript object basics. A library is created. The books in the library have the following properties: Author, title, number of pages, publisher, publication date, read status. There is a button to add new books. Each book's display includes a button to remove the book from the library and another button to update the book's read status. The book records are not stored in either the local storage or a database. In the development of this project, eslint and prettier were used, as well. The original project description is on this [link][Odin-link]. 

My implementation of the project can be reached [here][My-implementation].

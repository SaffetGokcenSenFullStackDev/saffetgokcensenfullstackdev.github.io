This is my tenth project in my journey to being a full stack developer. The aim of this project is to practice working with modules. "webpack" is used as the bundler. A restaurant webpage is created and styled for large-screen devices. Tabbed browsing is performed. The original project description is on this [link][Odin-link]. 

My implementation of the project for large screen devices can be reached [here][My-implementation].
